Given the time required to the development of this app, which is between 1.5 to 3 hours, these are the features implemented:

- displayed weather information based on the user's current location
- forecast for 5 days
- pull the table to refresh the information
- conversion Celsius/Fahrenheit and vice versa

Here in the following the list of things still to do given more time (estimation given):

- error management (4 hours)
- multilingual support (2 hours)
- share (3 hours)
- move the icon app and the splash screen inside the assets folder (this means having different sizes of the image) (1 hour)
- better design (fonts and colours)
- ability to add city manually (this require a new design introducing the scrolling view) (8 hours)
- save and delete favourite cities (4 hours)
- unit tests
